Could base the whole thing off widgets?
- Each widget can create or listen to signals, like in Godot
- Each widget can do networking on its own, but it should not have...
  mmm it should not block on anything? So each one will need some way 
  to register its curl stuff to the multi system. Perhaps that system should
  also have a way to register the things you want to toss after connecting.
  All the headers and junk. Possible if you wrap it all in some special
  connection type (you already have one)
- Widget can refresh itself, or should the caller refresh it? Only the 
  widget knows when it needs to be refreshed, or should we just refresh it
  every time? Perhaps the widget could just have a "process" function and each
  widget can do what it needs to each frame?
  - What about things that overlap each other? The order of drawing the widgets
    is probably determined by the caller program, and i think the refresh 
    HAS to happen in a certain order. 
  - So... yeah, the widget needs to TELL the caller when they need to be
    redrawn I guess, and then they need a redraw function. Well no, they can
    all redraw themselves, since they're all separate buffers, and then the
    caller can figure out when they need to call wnoutrefresh
- So widgets have to redraw themselves but report to the caller when they need
  to be refreshed globally. What about the network stuff? What about the input?
  Do I pass the input into each widget? Probbbaaabllyyyy???
