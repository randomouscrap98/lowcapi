simple program which acts like a POSIX thing

CAPICHAT_TOKEN=$(capi-chat qcs./api auth)
capi-chat qcs./api listen 000000
capi-chat qcs./api send 
# chat.txt

source env
while true; do
	nano chat.txt
   cat chat.txt > capi-chat qcs./api send
	capi-chat qcs./api chat.txt
done


- various commands it can run, like auth, listen, send
- basic wrapper around the small api
- output the listen stuff directly
- but couldn't the user do this with a bash script?
  - Maybe it WOULD be better as a bash script

- Maybe could simply provide an extremely basic 
  example implementation for you as a bash script, 
  let users write it themselves. After all, the 
  "small" endpoint does nearly all of the work for you;
